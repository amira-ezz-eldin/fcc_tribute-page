        <p>
          Inventor Thomas Alva Edison profoundly influenced modern life through
          inventions such as the incandescent light bulb, the phonograph, and
          the motion picture camera. During his lifetime, he acquired 1,093
          patents, and marketed many of his inventions to the public.
